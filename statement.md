Project Statement: Python PDF Utility Script

Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this utility is the lack of a simple, consolidated, and free command-line tool for essential PDF operations. Users often require separate, expensive, or complex software to perform actions like quickly converting text to a PDF, merging new content into a long document, or reducing oversized files.

Scope of the Project

The scope of the project is strictly limited to a single-file, command-line utility offering three core, non-interactive PDF manipulation functions. It focuses entirely on text-based input and file I/O operations without relying on web services, databases, or graphical user interfaces.

In Scope:

PDF creation from plain text.

Pre-pending one PDF to another.

Basic content stream compression.

CLI menu interface.

Basic file I/O error handling.

Out of Scope:

Advanced editing (e.g., content modification, watermarking).

GUI development.

Batch processing.

Database or persistent storage.

Target Users

Developers/Programmers: Who need quick, scriptable PDF operations integrated into automated workflows or build processes.

Individuals: Seeking a free, fast alternative to commercial software for simple, daily PDF tasks (e.g., quickly creating a single document, merging a cover page).

Small Teams: Requiring a lightweight tool to manage document size and combine reports without relying on web-based or paid services.

High-Level Features

PDF Creation: Generate a new PDF file from user-provided title and body text.

PDF Merging/Editing: Combine a new content page with an existing PDF, ensuring the new content is added first.

PDF Compression: Reduce the file size of an existing PDF document for easier sharing or storage.
